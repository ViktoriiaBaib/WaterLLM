Project: **WaterLLM: Creating a Custom ChatGPT for Water Purification Using Prompt-
Engineering Techniques**  

Team: Viktoriia Baibakova, Maryam Ghazizade Fard, Teslim Olayiwola, Olga Taran

This repository contains a promt for a custom chatGPT enhanced with RAG. Papers that we uploaded under Knowledge were retieved from Google Scholar and can be found there. 
This chatbot focuses on advanced oxidation procedures (AOPs) for water purification from microplastics (MPs).

The project was built during a hackathon **LLMs for Materials and Chemistry 2024**.
